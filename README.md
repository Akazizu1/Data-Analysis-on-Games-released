# Data-Analysis-on-Games-released
This project explores video game play times , trends, and projections using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). The notebook provides insights into platform performance, future projections, and gameplay duration comparisons.


1. Dataset Loading & Cleaning

Load the dataset (video game sales & playtime).

Handle missing values and prepare data for analysis.

2. Sales Trends & Projections

Analyze sales across different platforms and years.

Use linear regression to project future trends in global sales.

Compare projections across consoles on a single graph.

3. Top Platforms Analysis

Identify the most successful platforms.

Visualize platform-wise sales comparisons.

Explore how platforms evolved over time.

4. Longest Games Analysis

Highlight the single longest game in the dataset.

Compare the longest games across all platforms.

Create clear and readable bar plots for easy interpretation.

5. Insights

Which platforms dominated historically?

Which consoles show potential future growth?

How does game length vary across platforms?

6. Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

pandas – data cleaning & manipulation

matplotlib / seaborn – data visualization

scikit-learn – regression for future projections
